                \nLeaving reviews for an app not only helps the users and the developers, but also the Google Play Store itself. The Play Store's goal as an app platform is to show you fast, accurate, and personalized results when you search for your desired app and keep spam apps away.
                To make that happen, it needs information on the app's performanceâ€”which is displayed via user reviews. An app that has a 4.5-star rating is most probably safer and more relevant than an app with a 2-star rating of the same genre.
                \nThis information helps Google's algorithm better rank the apps on the Play Store and bring you high-quality app results that you are most likely to download and have a good experience with. The more favorable an app's rating and reviews, 
                the more the number of people downloading that app and using Play Store's services.""")
